# Build status — live ledger

**Updated by every agent on every state transition.** Always
read from origin/main; never trust a stale local copy.

Status values: `TODO` (claim me) · `CLAIMED` (someone is
working) · `IN_REVIEW` (PR open) · `MERGED` (on main) ·
`BLOCKED` (needs unblock).

When you claim or update a row, commit BUILD_STATUS.md with
message `status: <action> <brief-id>` (e.g. `status: claim
C-gmail`, `status: C-gmail in review (#812)`).

## Picking your next brief

Codex picks the first row where:
- `owner == codex`
- `status == TODO`
- All "waits on" predecessors have `status == MERGED`

Claude picks the first row where:
- `owner == claude`
- `status == TODO`
- All "waits on" predecessors have `status == MERGED`

If multiple agents try to claim the same row, the one whose
commit lands first on main wins. The losers will see the row is
already CLAIMED on their next pull and pick a different one.
